# Introduction to Machine Learning with PyTorch
November 12, 2024

This is a set of Jupyter Notebooks that are intended to be a brief introduction to using PyTorch and creating neural networks with the library.  These discuss the autogradient feature, optimization routines, the neural network helper classes, data loading, and also provide a few example neural network implementations.

This is based off previous PyTorch seminars in CSE:

- [Hands-On with CSE 2021](https://github.com/nicknytko/cse-pytorch-workshop/)
- [Hands-On with CSE 2019](https://github.com/compdyn/pytorch_tutorial)
